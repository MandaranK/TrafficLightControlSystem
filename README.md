# TrafficLightControlSystem
Programmed to simulated a system on an FPGA board designed to regulate automated traffic light sequencing with added pedestrian interaction features. The system utilized various components, including a 7-segment multiplexer, push button inputs, holding register, and synchronizer. Created a Finite State Machine on a FPGA board using VHDL in Quartus Prime.
